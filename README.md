## Local Art Finder

This is an app created to help you discover local artists by displaying their art work, the galleries you can view their work at, and events being held near your location.

## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        $ gem install rails
        
2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Navigate to the application directory in the command prompt.

4. Once you are in the directory type:
        
        $ bundle
   Then:

        $ rake db:migrate

5. Then, you will need to run the rails server while still within the app directory:
        
        $ rails s
 
 6. Open your browser and within the address bar type:
 
        localhost:3000
  
 7. Enjoy our app!
